title: Setting Up Test Targets
difficulty: Basic
time: Approximately 5 minutes
---

In this exercise you will create targets that you can use to experiment with Bolt. You can also use existing targets in your system if you prefer.

- [Existing Targets](#existing-targets)
- [Using Vagrant](#using-vagrant)
- [Using Docker](#using-docker)
- [Creating an Inventory File](#creating-an-inventory-file)

## Prerequisites
To use an attached configuration file to set up test targets, you must have one of the following installed on your machine:

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

## Existing Targets

If you already have, or can easily launch, a few Linux or Windows targets then you're all set. These targets must be accessible via SSH or WinRM; if you can  access them via an SSH or WinRM client then Bolt can, too.

## Using Vagrant
**Note:** These instructions assume that you are familiar with Vagrant and have a suitable hypervisor configured.

The attached Vagrantfile configures three CentOS 7 targets and a Windows (Nano Server) target.

Save the following code as `Vagrantfile`. To configure a different number of targets, change the `TARGETS` environment variable.

```ruby
{% include lesson1-10/Vagrantfile -%}
```

From the command line, ensure youâ€™re in the directory where you stored the Vagrantfile file and enter `vagrant up`.

Generate the SSH configuration so Bolt knows how to authenticate with the SSH daemon. The following command will output the required details.

```bash
vagrant ssh-config
```

You can save that so it will be automatically picked up by most SSH clients, including Bolt. This uses the ability to specify hosts along with their connection details in a [configuration file](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config).

```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh
vagrant ssh-config >> ~/.ssh/config
```

By saving this SSH configuration file, you can use the target name, rather than the IP address. When passing targets to Bolt in the following exercises with Linux you will use `--targets target1,target2`.

Make sure you can SSH into all of your targets. If you've used the vagrant targets before you may have to remove entries from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

```bash
ssh target1
ssh target2
ssh target3
```

## Using Docker
Using Docker we can quickly launch a number of ephemeral SSH servers. To make that even easier we'll use Docker Compose.

Save the following code as `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
{% include lesson1-10/docker-compose.yml -%}
```

Save the following code as `Dockerfile`.

```docker
{% include lesson1-10/Dockerfile -%}
```

Launch a single SSH server in the background: `docker-compose up -d`. To launch more SSH servers, run:  `docker-compose up --scale ssh=3 -d`.

View a list of running containers: `docker-compose ps`. The result should be similar to:

```
        Name                 Command        State           Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2acquiringtargets_ssh_1   /usr/sbin/sshd -D   Up      0.0.0.0:32768->22/tcp
2acquiringtargets_ssh_2   /usr/sbin/sshd -D   Up      0.0.0.0:32769->22/tcp
```

Note the `Ports` column. We are forwarding a local port to the SSH server running in the container. Using the example above, you can SSH to `127.0.0.1:32768`.

If you have a local SSH client, test the connection. Change the port to one you get from running the `docker-compose ps` command. The image sets the username and password to `root`.

```bash
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 32768
```

Make sure you can log into all the targets before moving on. You may have to remove some entries from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`

When passing targets to Bolt in the next section you will use `--targets 127.0.0.1:32768,127.0.0.1:32769`, replacing the ports with those you see when you run the `docker-compose ps` command.

## Creating an Inventory File

In Bolt, you can use an inventory file to store information about your targets. For example, you can organize your targets into groups or set up connection information for targets or target groups. In this lab, you'll make use of the groups defined in the following inventory file.

The inventory file is a yaml file stored by default at `inventory.yaml` inside the Bolt project directory. Save the following at `Boltdir/inventory.yaml`:

```yaml
{% include lesson1-10/Boltdir/inventory.yaml -%}
```

While an inventory file is not necessary for running Bolt, it does make referencing the test targets and setting some configuration options a little easier. Instead of targetting each individual target by using `--targets target1,target2,target3` you can target them at all once by using their group name like so `--targets linux`.

You can read more about the inventory file in the [official documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/inventory_file.html).

## Next Steps

Now that you have set up test targets to use with Bolt you can move on to:
